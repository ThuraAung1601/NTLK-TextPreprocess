I am from a middle-class family of Bihar, I am Naresh Shukla. Nobody comes in this world, without the support of family and friends. Actually, whatever you will be, it is just because of your family. My father is a respectable bussinessman in our community. Mother is a doctor. They both have their occupation. That's I have learned from my parents the value of time, honesty, hard work and commitment to the purpose.
