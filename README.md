# Text Preprocessing
- Text normalization includes:
  - converting all letters to lower or upper case
  - converting numbers into words or removing numbers
  - removing punctuations, accent marks and other diacritics
  - removing white spaces
  - expanding abbreviations
  - removing stop words, sparse terms, and particular words
  - text canonicalization (tumor = tumour, it's = it is)
